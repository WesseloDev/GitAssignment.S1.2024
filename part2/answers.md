## Part 2: Questions
#### 1. List three major version control for software engineering.
1. Git
2. Perforce
3. Mercurial

#### 2. What are the main advantages to using Git in your software development, and how is it useful for game developers?
Some of the main advantages of using Git for software development is that it allows you to collaborate with other coders on the same project, and it lets you view the history of everything that has been added to the project, who added it, and when.

It's useful for game developers because collaborating on projects is an important part of game development. It's also useful because if an error is introduced, or if a lot of important files are deleted, you can revert to an earlier version.

#### 3. Define the following terms in relation to Git: branch, pull, push, repository, working copy, merge

- branch: a separate copy of your repository, that can have different changes made in comparison to your main or other branches. It serves as a snapshot of a specific point of your repository that you can make changes to from there, or merge into other branches.
- pull: asking for the most up to date version of your repository, and receiving all of the changes and new files that have happened since you last pulled.
- push: sending any changes that you've made to your repository.
- repository: the place that stores your code and files for the project that you're currently working on. It tracks and saves all of the changes that are made to it.
