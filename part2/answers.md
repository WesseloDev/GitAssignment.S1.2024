Some of the main advantages of using Git for software development is that it allows you to collaborate with other coders on the same project, and it lets you view the history of everything that has been added to the project, who added it, and when.

It's useful for game developers because collaborating on projects is an important part of game development. It's also useful because if an error is introduced, or if a lot of important files are deleted, you can revert to an earlier version.
